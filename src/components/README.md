# Components Directory Structure

This directory contains all React components used in the Learning2Trade application.

## Directory Structure

- `ui/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `layout/`: Layout components (header, footer, navigation, etc.)

## Component Guidelines

1. Each component should be in its own directory with its associated files (styles, tests, etc.)
2. Use TypeScript for all components
3. Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for component files
4. Include proper TypeScript types for props
5. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
